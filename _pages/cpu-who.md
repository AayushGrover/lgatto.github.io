## CPU core

- [**Laurent Gatto**](http://lgatto.github.io/about/), head of the
  unit. He moved to Cambridge in January 2010 to work in the Cambridge
  Centre for Proteomics on various aspects of quantitative and spatial
  proteomics, developing methodological advances and implementing
  computational tools with a strong emphasis on rigorous and
  reproducible data analysis. He is also a visiting scientist in the
  [PRIDE team](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) at the European
  Bioinformatics Institute, affiliate teaching staff at the
  [Cambridge Computational Biology Institute](http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk/),
  a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
  fellow and a [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
  [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) instructor.

- [**Lisa Breckels**](https://lmsimp.github.io/), Post-Doctoral
  Research Associate. Lisa joined the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics
  in November 2010 to work on the application of machipne learning
  techniques to the sub-cellular localisation of proteins using
  quantitative experimental organelle proteomics. She joined the CPU
  in August 2013.

## Remote members 

- **Sebastian Gibb**, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care,
  University Medicine Greifswald, Germany. Sebastian visited the group
  2014 and is since then contributing to various projects, in
  particular [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase),
  [`Pbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Pbase) and
  [`synapter`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/synapter), which he is
  currently leading the development of.

- **Johannes Rainer**, Center for Biomedicine, EURAC, Bolzano, Italy
  is a contributor to the [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase)
  and [`Pbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Pbase) packages.

## Collaborators 

- [**Kathyn S. Lilley**](http://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/people/uto/lilley),
  Cambridge Centre for Proteomics, Department of Biochemistry,
  University of Cambridge, UL. Kathryn's lab developed the
  state-of-the art LOPIT
  ([Dunkley *et al.* 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16618929))
  and hyperLOPIT
  ([Christoforou *et al.* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26754106)). Her
  lab is at the origin of some of the very best spatial proteomics
  datasets, which we help analyse and interpret by applying our
  dedicated software (see for example
  [Breckels *et al.* 2016 in F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2926/)).

- [**Sean Holden**](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/), Computer
  Laboratory. We collaborate with Sean on the development and
  application of machine learning algorithms to solve problems in
  spatial proteomics. A recent example is transfer learning
  ([Breckels *et al.* 2016](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004920)).

- [**Thomas Burger**](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage/),
  BIG-BGE (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA, INSERM), 38000
  Grenoble, France. We collaborate with Thomas and his group on
  various proteomics data analysis (for example missing data in
  [Lazar *et al* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906401))
  and software (see
  [Wieczorek *et al.* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27605098)). Thomas
  contributed the *perTurbo* algorithms to
  [*pRoloc*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pRoloc).

## Alumni 

- **Thomas Naake**, visited the group in Spring 2014 as an ERASMUS
  student affiliated to the University of Freiburg. He developed the
  first version of
  [`pRolocGUI`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pRolocGUI.html),
  an interactive visualisation tools for organelle proteomics
  data. Thomas is now a PhD student at Max Planck Institute of
  Molecular Plant Physiology.

- **Vicky Butt**, Part III student in Systems Biology, applying
  graph-based methods to study protein sub-cellular
  localisation. Vicky is now pursuing a PhD at UCL.
