The **Computational Proteomics Unit** was set up in August 2013 and is
part of the
[Cambridge Centre for Proteomics](http://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/). Its
main activities centre around the sound analysis of proteomics data
and integration of different sources of heterogeneous data. We work in
close collaboration with biologists to tackle biologically challenging
questions using statistics and machine learning to understand the data
and uncover biologically relevant patterns. The development and
publication of scientific software
([1](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit),
[2](https://github.com/lgatto)) is an integral part of our work and is
reflected by our contributions to the
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project.

research, proteomics.

# Open Science and Reproducible Research 

We are committed to the open, transparent and rigorous practice of
scientific enquiry. In particular, we will make every possible efforts
to make our
[research repeatable, reproducible and replicable](http://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/),
in the hope that it can be re-used and improved upon by as many as
possible. Concomitantly, we will release all our software and data
under open permissible licences. Finally, we will also ensure that our
research (such as, but not limited to journals articles,
presentations, and book chapters) is published under open access
licences to allow everybody to freely read, re-used and mine it.

# Good practice 

Software engineering and programming are an important aspect of our
work. We hence try to adopt common good practice and coding style.

See the
[wiki](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit/www/wiki) for
some useful links.

# Code of Conduct

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree
with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as
needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe
environment for everybody.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab
members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not
appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations,
or discussions. (However, do note that we work on biological matters
so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are
appropriate.)

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact Laurent Gatto
immediately. If Laurent is the cause of your concern, Kirstie Whitaker
(kw401 AT cam.ac.uk) is a good informal point of contact; and has
agreed to mediate.

For official concerns, please see the Universities
[Public Equality Duties](http://www.equality.admin.cam.ac.uk/training/equalities-law/public-equality-duties)
page.

(This code of conduct is inspired from the Titus Brown's
[Data Intensive Biology at UC Davis Code of Conduct](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html).)

# Funding 

Since 2010, we have benefited from the financial support from the
**BBSRC**, the **7th Framework Programme of the European Union**
(Contract no. 262067 [PRIME-XS](http://www.primexs.eu/)) and the
**Wellcome Trust**.
