The **Computational Proteomics Unit** was set up in August 2013 and is
part of the
[Cambridge Centre for Proteomics](http://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/). Its
main activities centre around the sound analysis of proteomics data
and integration of different sources of heterogeneous data. We work in
close collaboration with biologists to tackle biologically challenging
questions using statistics and machine learning to understand the data
and uncover biologically relevant patterns. The development and
publication of scientific software
([1](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit),
[2](https://github.com/lgatto)) is an integral part of our work and is
reflected by our contributions to the
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project.

**Keywords**: data analysis, experimental design, statistics,
programming, R, scientific software, machine learning, reproducible
research, proteomics.

# Open Science and Reproducible Research 

We are committed to the open, transparent and rigorous practice of
scientific enquiry. In particular, we make every possible effort to
make our [research repeatable, reproducible and
replicable](http://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/), in
the hope that it can be re-used and improved upon by as many as
possible. Concomitantly, we release all our software and data
under open permissible licences. Finally, we will also ensure that our
research (such as, but not limited to journals articles,
presentations, and book chapters) is published under open access
licences to allow everybody to freely read, re-use and mine it.

# Good practice 

Software engineering and programming are an important aspect of our
work. We hence try to adopt common good practice and coding style.

See the
[wiki](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit/cputools/wiki)
for some useful links.

# Code of Conduct

The lab is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free
experience for everyone, and we expect cooperation from all members to
help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. See the [Code of
conduct](https://lgatto.github.io/cpu-coc/) page for a longer version.

# Funding 

Since 2010, we have benefited from the financial support from the
**BBSRC**, the **7th Framework Programme of the European Union**
(Contract no. 262067 [PRIME-XS](http://www.primexs.eu/)) and the
**Wellcome Trust**.
