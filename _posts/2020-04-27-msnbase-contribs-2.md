I wrote the [first `MSnbase` contributions
post](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/) on the 27 November
2016 (udpated on the 4 January 2018), exactly 1247 day (3 years and 5
months) ago. It is time for another short update.

Since my first public commit on Mon 4 October 2010 at 23:35:23 (that's
over 9.5 years), the package benefited from contributions from
Guangchuang Yu, Samuel Wieczorek, Cosmin Lazar, Vlad Petyuk, Thomas
Naake, Sebastian Gibb (who has since become core
developer/maintainer), Richie Cotton, Martina Fischer, Johannes Rainer
(also a core developer/maintainer) and Arne Smits. Since earlier this
year, there's now also Steffen Neuman.

### Steffen Neumann

Steffen and I have already been working and developing packages
together. We have been maintaing
[`mzR`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html)
for 8.5 years. Earlier this month, he contributed support for the
MzTab-M 2.0 format for metabolomics data and reintroduced support for
writing MzTab data.

This tallies the number of contributions to 12 so far. Thank you very
much!
