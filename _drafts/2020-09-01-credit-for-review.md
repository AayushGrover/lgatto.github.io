Of course, it is only fair to get credit for the time and efforts
researchers invest in reviewing their peers work. Especially so for
early career researchers. But we should be careful what we wish for!

<!--more-->

First of all, when we say credit, some will hear metrics. Researchers
are already endure considerable pressure in reaching an ever
increasing number of metrics in an ever increasing businessification
of the academia. The time and efforts put of peer review mustn't equate
to yet another been counting exercise and escalation of number games:
How many articles have you reviews? For what journals?

Our reviews and efforts mustn't become yet more data that is instrument
of commercial control over researchers and research outputs. We have
seen where this leads with the many commercial predators that rule
scientific publishing. [Publons](https://publons.com/about/home/), is
a site that *track, verify, and showcase their peer review and
editorial contributions*. While positive on first sight, the company
was bought in 2017 by Clarivate Analytics, the company that manages
the infamous and harmful impact factor.

Finally, and this is by far the most important demand for any sensible
credit for peer reviewing, is the absolute requirement for our peer
review reports to be openly published. Without this, any initiative
for to get credit for our work is meaningless and will inexorably lead
to a meaningless and weaponised bean counting.

  Review](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2020/08/17/revisiting-the-problems-with-credit-for-peer-review-2/),
  that highligths some of my points above: "If [...] we turn peer
  review into a mandatory career requirement that is rewarded with
  credit, it changes the nature of the behavior." and "A second
  problem with peer review credit schemes [...] is the increased power
  it places in the hands of publishers and editors."

- [Getting credit for peer
  review](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/02/getting-credit-peer-review),
  from 2016, briefly talks about different platforms to earn peer
  review credits, but completely misses the essential point of open
  peer review.
