This is an modified version of the [Becoming a better scientist with
open and reproducible research](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-publ/)
talk that I gave at TU Delft in May 2019. This version is modified and
was prepared for the [Virtual Bioinformatics Student
Symposium](http://www.rsg-belgium.iscbsc.org/event/student-symposium/student-symposium-04-12-2020/)
on the 4 December 2020.

## Introduction

I want to start by thanking the organisers for the invitation to share
with you some of my experiences and opinions about open and
reproducible research, and how these ideas should guide us in what we
do.

By all means, ask any questions along the way. I do plan to finish on
time for questions, but feel free to interupt me any time.

I am particularly delighted because not only I can speak about a topic
that is very close to my heart and I can also share it with early
career researchers, which makes it even more thrilling. It makes it
even more thrilling because you are those thay (hopefully) can make a
bigger change for the best. Believe it or not, you are very unlikely
to be able to rely on your senior peers to drive that change.

**Disclaimer:** I said that I wanted to my experiences and opinions. I
am not speaking from authority here. Authority generally comes from
seniority, and in most cases senior academics aren't those that have
much experience in open and reproducible research. 

Another thing I don't plan doing is listing technical solutions on how
to implement open and reproducible research. I would be very happy to
answer your technical questions if you have any, or follow up by email
or twitter. You'll also have the oportunity to discuss with your peers
during the social gathering, many of which will be able to help very
efficiently. The main reason I won't focus on technical aspects of
open and reproducible research is that I very much doubt that
technical aspects are the real barrier. We have many solutions at
hand. The real challenges are the (academic) environment we are in,
the inertia of academia and the vested interests of many senior
actors.

Note however that the principles, implicit or explicity of open
research/science aren't new. I was pleasantly surprised when learning
about the **[Mertonian
norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms)** from 1942.

- **Communism**: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific
  goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration;
  secrecy is the opposite of this norm.

- **Universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the
  sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants.

- **Disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
  common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them
  
- **Organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.

Before we continue, two quick remarks about open and reproducible
research in relation with the title of my talk, and I will of course
define discuss these terms in more details later - I will just assume
for now that you know, at least vaguely, what I am referring to.

- A piece of open research doesn't automatically make it good, where
  good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of closed
  research doesn't make it bad, where bad here is defined of low
  academic quality. So openness doesn't equate to academic
  quality. But openness provides some desired quality (i.e. desirable
  property) independent from academic excellent. Openness leads to
  trust (more details later).

- A piece of reproducible research doesn't automatically make it good,
  where good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of non
  reproducible research doesn't make it bad, where bad here is defined
  of low academic quality. So reproducible doesn't equate to academic
  quality. But reproducibility provides some desired quality
  (i.e. desirable property) independent from academic
  excellent. Reproducibility leads (among other things) to trust (see
  details below).

Open research and reproducible research aren't the same thing, and one
doesn't imply the other. Even though in our modern understanding of
these terms and concepts, they are intimately linked, historically,
they are very different.

## So what is open research?

Open science has seen a continuous evolution since the 17th century,
with the advent of dissemination of research in scientific journals
and the societal demand to access scientific knowledge at
large. Technology and communication has further accelerated this
evolution, and put it in the spot light among researchers and
academics (for for examples funder mandates) and more widely in the
press with the cost of publications (see for example this Guardian
*long read* article [Is the staggeringly profitable business of
scientific publishing bad for
science?](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)
or the [Paywall](https://paywallthemovie.com/) movie).

So what is open research? What characterises a modern open researcher?

Let's start with a definition

> Open science/research is the process of transparent dissemination
> and access to knowledge, that can be applied to various scientific
> practices (image below from Wikipedia):

and a figure

![The six principles of open science](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Open_Science_-_Prinzipien.png)

As a result

> Open science/research can mean different things to different people,
> in particular when declined it along its many technical and
> philosophical attributes.

What I mislike about the previous figure is that it can give the
misleading impression that open research is about collecting badges,
and that the more badges you possess, the better an open researcher
you are. And reciprocally, not having any badge to display
**excludes** one from being an open researcher. And as soon as people
start to believe this, we will stop practicing open research and will
start doing stamp collection.

Incidently, here's an ironic tweet that offers tips to do exactly that:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">21 Tips on

how to sound like an open scientist, without actually doing open
science. Enjoy! <a

On a side note, I very much prefer the Martonian norms shown above
that address more fundamental principles intimately related to the
principles of open research.

The important word above is excludes: as thriving open researchers, we
need to understand that it isn't only the distance towards better/open
research that we have travelled that is relevant, but that the
starting point matters a lot. The way somebody practices open
research, whether that person has the possibility to implement this or
that open (and reproducible) research practice, or whether they can be
vocal about it mostly depends on their environment and the support or
push back they get.


Embrace open and reproducible research to the extend you want and you
can. Seek allies and support around you, but do not feel pressured. It
isn't open or close. It is certainly not the same open or close for
everybody.

So my very first take-home messages are:


> Open isn't binary, it's a gradient, it's multidisciplinary, it's
> multidimensional.

How to be an open scientist:

> Let's be open and understanding of different situations and
> constraints, including our own.

## Perverse side-effects: open research as a business

Everything that is labelled as open research isn't open of good. An
easy example is ~~Open Access~~ **Open Ace$$**, a very lucrative
business model set up by commerical publishers... and supported,
directly or indirectly by most researchers.

- **Green open access**: post your **pre-print** (on
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/),
  ...), get a DOI and credit. :-)

- **Gold open access**: pay a lot of moeny (APC article processing
  charge), typically 3000 -
  [9000](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) Euros to
  publish your article in a journal under an open access
  licence. **For-profit** publishing (typically **huge profits**). :-(

- **Platinum (diamond) open access** :-) : 100% free to pubish and
  free to read, usually financed by university, funders, research
  organisations centrally. **Non-profit publishing**. :-)

- **Read and publish 'transformative' agreements**: combining
  subscriptions (to read) and APCs into big deals, this (1)
  obfuscating real costs, (2) lock-in into a contract with specific
  publishers, and (3) discriminate against institutions/countries that
  can't afford them (see this
  [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUuoHV8yA0TSLUCo0PhrzfR5lwWruZQibKimOoVVJ6E/edit?usp=sharing)
  by Corina Logan and Dieter Lukas for more details). :-(

There is 

> Open Science as in widely disseminated and openly accessible

and

> Open Science as in inclusive and welcoming

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"

As far as I was concerned for a long time (until June 2017 to be
accurate - this section is based this [Open science and open
science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/) post), the former
more technical definition was always what I was focusing on, and the
second community-level aspect of openness was, somehow, implicit from
the former, but that's clearly not the case. 

Even if there are efforts to promote diversity, under-represented
minorities (URM) don't necessarily feel
[included](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1101.full).
When it comes to open science/research URMs can be further
discriminated against by greater exposure or, can't always afford to
be vocal.

- Not everybody has the privilege to be open.
- There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one
  could afford to be.
- Every voice and support is welcome.

Given the very broad views and opinions about what open research is,
or is supposed to be, I think we can agree with [Cameron
Neylon](https://twitter.com/CameronNeylon/status/895546085468495873):

## Ethical publishing

[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com/)
([@LoganCorina](https://twitter.com/LoganCorina) on twitter) started
to talk already many years ago about ethical publishing (for research
dissemination at large). I wasn't immediately sold on this phrasing,
but I now came to the realisation that it's spot on. 

> We should think about the ethical implications of how we perform and
> disseminate our research.

(Thank you Corina).

## Why becoming an open research practitioners

It's the right thing to do. See the **The Mertonian norms**... Or is it?

**Benefits for your academic career**: some examples from the [**Open
as a career boost**](https://lgatto.github.io/EPFL-open-science/)
paragraph:

- Open access articles get more citations.
- Data availability is associated with citation benefit.
- Openly available software more likely to be used. (I don't have any
  reference for this, and there are of course many couter examples).

**Networking opportunities** (I'm here thanks to my open research
activities with my former colleague Marta Teperek at the University of
Cambridge, UK).

See also [**Why Open Research**](http://whyopenresearch.org/index)

- **Increase your visibility**: Build a name for yourself. Share your
  work and make it more visible.

- **Reduce publishing costs**: Open publishing can cost the same or
  less than traditional publishing.

- **Take back control**: Know your rights. Keep your rights. Decide
  how your work is used

- **Publish where you want**: Publish in the journal of your choice
  and archive an open copy. (See [The cost of
  knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) boycott of Elsevier).
  
- **Get more funding**: Meet funder requirements, and qualify for
  special funds such as the Wellcome Trust [Open Research
  Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/open-research-fund).
  
- **Get that promotion**: Open research is increasingly recognised in
  promotion and tenure. See also [Reproducibility and open science are
  starting to matter in tenure and
  promotion](https://cos.io/blog/are-reproducibility-and-open-science-starting-matter-tenure-and-promotion-review/)
  July 14th, 2017, Brian Nosek) and the EU's [Evaluation of Research
  Careers fully acknowledging Open Science
  Practice](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/os-rewards-wgreport-final_integrated_0.pdf)
  defines an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM):

But are there **any risks**?

> Does it take more time to work openly? 

Isn't it worth investing time is managing data in a way that others
(including future self) can find and understand it? That's, IMHO,
particularly important from a group leader's perspective, where I want
to build a corpus of data/software/research that other lab members can
find, mine and re-use.

> Are senior academics always supportive?

No.

> Is there a risk of being scooped?

There certainly is a benefit if releasing one's research early!

But, importantly, working with open and reproducible research in mind
**doesn't mean releasing everything prematurely**, it means

- managing research in a way one can find data and results at every
  stage

- one can **reproduce/repeat** results, re-run/compare them with new
  data or different methods/parameters, and

- one can **release** data (or parts thereof) when/if **appropriate**.

So, are there any risks?

## Why and what reproducibility

1. Reproducibility isn't the point.
2. Reprodcucible isn't open.
3. Open isn't reproducible.
